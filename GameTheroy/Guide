      solution  ?? 
          winining  && losing states  , more will be for each type

Games  >> 
     General techniques     
          trying to find intersting facts >>  best strategy (odd, even  , change               of sum)
          
           can we dp 

     Impartial Games  (two players with the same moves  with same goal)
             so far it's part of gen games so we will add more

           Nim Game >>  xor 1 win  , lose            , having operation like add becuase wining can undo
           Misere Game >> (who cant win)  : 
                If all heaps are size 1:

	          If all heaps are size 1:

                       If there are an even number of 1’s → winning.
 
                        If there are an odd number of 1’s → losing.

                If at least one heap ≥ 2, play like normal Nim:

                        XOR = 0 → losing.

                        XOR ≠ 0 → winning

          Grundy Theorem if we have game consisit of sub games
                  he key condition for Sprague-Grundy theorem to apply is:
                  The overall game is a disjunct union of independent subgames.
                  for each game we calc grundy Number and aplly normal Nim 

                what if the game transtions consist of subGames of same type(problem)  (xor them  and the reuslt is the grundy num ! that shoul be returned if i mixed them in one state)

                 Here we try to simplif game as much as we can before we go 
                Note we only care that two  players play as one player regardles change rules by state


         considering all grundy childs are not always possible so consider pattern  , imagine subpart is true  prove by induction

             
      other
             hard  , we won't consider
